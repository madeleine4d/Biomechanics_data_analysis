### Hello!
This is a basic program for analysing ADInstruments PowerLab 15T LabChart output files. Includes a command line interface so it should be somewhat plug and play. 
Files included:
- Analyzer.py: this is the actual script. after reviewing the code just run it to get started.
- MVC, DLS, SLS files: these are sample data files. Some may have duplicats for testing multiple entry functionality
- data.csv: this is the data from out biomechanics project
